# Depth-Capture-System

3D Reconstruction final project code for CS1430 Computer Vision. 

The codebase includes an implemented iOS app that captures RGB images, depth data, and camera intrinsics of a scene. The data is then used to create and visualize a 3D voxel model of the scene. Implemented in Swift and Python.
